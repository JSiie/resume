\cvsection[src/p1sidebar]{Profile}

I am a very curious person who showed great skills on logic problems since my childhood along with a strong creativity. Amongst others, this made me start playing go, doing photography, dancing and playing guitar. 
I then developed a huge interest in IT and everything in its orbit which conducted me to an engineering school.
Starting my career as a backend developer, I never ceased to go further in my job.
Along with my technical skills, my curiosity, my commitment and my communication skills lead me to became an IT architect 
in which I can share my thoughts about a bigger pictures.
